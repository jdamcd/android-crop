[![changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-1.0.1-lightgrey.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

## Features

* Gradle build & AAR
* Modern UI
* Backwards compatible to SDK 10
* Simple builder for configuration
* Example project

## Usage

First, declare `CropImageActivity` in your manifest file:

```xml
<activity android:name="com.soundcloud.android.crop.CropImageActivity" />
```

#### Crop

```java
Crop.of(inputUri, outputUri).asSquare().start(activity)
```

Listen for the result of the crop (see example project if you want to do some error handling):

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent result) {
    if (requestCode == Crop.REQUEST_CROP && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        doSomethingWithCroppedImage(outputUri);
    }
}
```
    
Some attributes are provided to customise the crop screen. See the example project [theme](https://github.com/jdamcd/android-crop/blob/master/example/src/main/res/values/theme.xml).

#### Pick

The library provides a utility method to start an image picker:

```java
Crop.pickImage(activity)
```

#### Dependency

The AAR is published on Maven Central:

```groovy
compile 'com.soundcloud.android:android-crop:1.0.1@aar'
```
